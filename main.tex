\begin{abstract}
Humans, in the last century, have filled the earth with computational entities. 
%
We find things able to compute in smartphones, fridges and watches. % improve this period
Nowadays, these devices aren't isolated; rather, they form a hoard of inter-communicating entities capable of achieving collective tasks. 
These systems (usually refered as Collective Adapative Systems) exhibit properties usually observed in complex such as node acting in concurrent, 
decentralized control and the global behaviour emerge from local interactions \cite{DBLP:conf/huc/Ferscha15}. 
Swarm of UAVs, a crowd of people, smart cities is all instances of these kinds of systems, usually called Collective Adaptive Systems.

In literature, different techniques aim at taming this complexity at the engineering level.
%
Among the many, two solutions that use a top-down approach in expressing global behaviour are TOTA~\cite{DBLP:journals/tosem/MameiZ09} and Aggregate Computing~\cite{DBLP:journals/computer/BealPV15} (both classified under the umbrella of Field-Based Coordination \cite{DBLP:books/daglib/0015276}).
%
The latter is a novel approach in which developers can express the collective behaviour by 
a functional manipulation of a distributed data structure called a computational field.
%
In bottom-up approaches instead, self-organization is something that emerges, tuning algorithm parameters.
%
Aggregate programming is backed by field calculus, a minimal set of instructions necessary to express whatever spatiotemporal computation using computational field manipulation~\cite{DBLP:conf/coordination/AudritoBDV18}. 
%
On top of that, different building blocks have been built, to facilitate the high-level library definition.
%
Furthermore, crafting a specific blocks category is possible to verify relevant properties such as self-stabilization \cite{DBLP:conf/coordination/ViroliD14} and eventual consistency~\cite{DBLP:conf/saso/BealVPD16}.
%
Practically though, building these basic blocks is not as easy as it sounds. Moreover, it is difficult to guarantee certain quality levels under different network conditions (e.g., different typology, high node mobility,...).

Outward of top-down declarative approaches, in the context of Multi Agent Systems other solutions leverage evolutionary computing \cite{DBLP:journals/swarm/BrambillaFBD13} and machine learning (in particular Multi Agent Reinforcement Learning \cite{DBLP:journals/tcyb/NguyenNN20}) to design distributed programs.
Using these techniques bring to near-optimum solution in specific tasks.
%
Unfortunately, though, the main problems of those solutions are the difficulty in scaling up application complexity and the "black-box" nature.

As far as we know, these two worlds are disjointed even if they speak a similar language. So our first intuition was merging these approaches. 
This has inevitably led us to ask ourselves these questions At what level of abstraction (middleware? Application API? Building blocks?) learning can be useful for Aggregate Computing? 
In related works, exists a well-known approach that easly match with Aggregate Computing? There are some benefits?

Starting from the first point, Aggregate Computing needs a platform in which programs will be executed. 
Here, designers need to define aspects that the paradigm doesn't include, such as evaluation frequency, program displacement, and trust.
These themes are tackled in part in different works \cite{DBLP:journals/scp/CasadeiAV18, DBLP:journals/fi/CasadeiPPVW20}, but learning -- both online and offline -- is usually not considered and here could be crucial, avoiding complex parameters tuning and improving the system robustness. 
Regarding evaluation frequency, related work already applied RL. Indeed, following an ad-hoc crafted reward function, we might bring the system to reduce energy consumption even in our solution.
